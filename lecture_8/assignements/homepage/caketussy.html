                        During the infamous worldwide pandemic, an idea made its way into the mind of Alberto, one of my
                        closest friends. This urge to express himself found its first outlet in a name and a logo: Caketussy&#174;.
                        Initially conceived as a community to bring together other people who shared his artistic drive,
                        pivotal ideal characterizing its first months of life, Caketussy&#174; gradually evolved and understood
                        its direction. In fact, only a few months after its creation, the first item was designed and made
                        available to friends and fans: the caps, or cakecaps.

                                <strong>Caketussy&#174; logo.</strong> Registered in 2020, this is the sole official version
                                of the logo. Other version are present in hats, shirts and lycras but are not rebranding while
                                personalized ideas for particular clothing items.

                        Alberto had many ideas but only two hands and a brain to bring them to life. To make matters more
                        complicated, like me, he was also studying at university. In this situation, Silvio and I came into
                        play. We threw ourselves fully into the project, trying to express our creativity through clothing,
                        photography, videos, drawings and poetry.

                                <strong>Flax yellow cake-cap.</strong> On the head of this monsterized Silvio the second
                                edition of the cake-cap (released in 2023) is. Compared to the first edition, they have a
                                superior etmbroidery, with more precise contours and brighter colors. They come in other three
                                colors: pistachio, jordy blue, and anti-flash white. Sewed on the back of the cap, the "Waste
                                Your Time Wisely" motto is replaced by the "Waste Your Time Smiling" one.

                        Although over the years we completed various artistic and clothing projects, we never truly managed
                        to define a clear mission until last year, when, with the help of Veronica, we decided to steer the
                        Caketussy&#174; project to sailing, a sport practiced by Alberto but to which Silvio and I had grown closer
                        over the years, having lived in a place like Trieste (Italy) where sailing is an integral part of the
                        culture.

                                <strong>Seahorse red lycra.</strong> The hydron, originally one of our sponsorized athletes, Kim,
                                is wearing the seahorse red lycra. These lycras were the second edition of the Caketussy&#174; very own
                                line, together with the pelican white and the hippopotamus grey ones.

                        <br>

                        Since then Caketussy&#174; has become more of a sportswear brand that nonetheless retains its artistic identity
                        striving to transform everything it touches into something unique, refined and appealing, both aesthetically
                        and in the lifestyle it promotes.

                                They are wearing the customized lycras designed and produced by us; you can find the cake-cap too.
