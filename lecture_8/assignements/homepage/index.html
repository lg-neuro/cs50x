                <div>

                    Ever since I was a child, I've been deeply passionate about scientific pursuits,
                    to some extent that it was even visible in the gifts I received from my relatives
                    ones. I vividly remember an <a href="https://www.unilibro.it/libro/l-enciclopedia-della-terra-ediz-illustrata/9788836546381?srsltid=AfmBOooCIjXk58qjee6vNgG-ksOheDRC9mX2Z3ICW3ITIcBQNNRzXF7X">
                    earth science book</a>, with its pages well-thumbed and loved, a rudimental optical
                    microscope and a telescope, both battered buy use.

                    <br> <br>

                    This curiosity led me to choose a scientifically-oriented high school, which set the
                    foundation of my scholarly education. In this period, I was really passionate about sciences,
                    mathematics and philosophy and, eventually, I decided to choose the Bachelor's Degree in Biological
                    Sciences and Technologies which provided me a broad and deep knowledge of life sciences. It was
                    during my II Year that I realized what captivated me most: the human brain, which, in part,
                    encompasses all three of my high-school passions. With this realization in mind I was brought to
                    undertake the International Master's Degree in Neuroscience.

                    <br> <br>

                    What truly intrigues me about the brain is its complexity and versatility: itâ€™s the same
                    entity I study that enables me to learn, reason, and ponder over new ideas investigate itself.
                    I do not want to sound too rhetorical but the its capacity to translate electrical inputs
                    into concrete actions and complex thoughts gives me always the impression to study some
                    science fiction.
