                        During my whole life, I've loved listening to music. Of course, as a child, I was introduced to it through
                        my parents’ tapes and CDs, so I ended up listening to a lot of rock-pop bands like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/The-police"><i>The Police</i></a>,
                        <a href="https://genius.com/artists/U2"><i>U2</i></a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Dire-straits"><i>Dire Straits</i></a>,
                        <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Queen"><i>Queen</i></a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Red-hot-chili-peppers"><i>Red Hot Chili Peppers</i></a>.
                        Besides these artists, my parents were also fans of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Zucchero"><i>Zucchero</i></a>,
                        an Italian soul singer, and the musical <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080455/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_teh%2520blues%2520brothers"><i>The Blues Brothers</i></a>,
                        which helped broaden my musical background since I got to know soul and blues as well.

                                <strong>The Blues Brothers (1980).</strong> During my whole life, I belive that I watched this movie
                                at least 50 times (Photo/<a href="https://www.mymovies.it/film/1980/thebluesbrothers/">mymovies.it</a>).

                        Out of pride for the region of Italy where I grew up, when I was around 10 years old, I started listening,
                        on my own initiative, to folk songs that were born during the World Wars, which were fought in the areas
                        I grew up in—particularly WWI. I became obsessed with a CD called <a href="https://www.discodue.com/catalogo/cd-usati/canti-di-montagna-del-coro-sat-e-altre-canzoni-degli-alpini-cd-usato.html">
                        <i>Canti di Montagna</i> (Mountain Chants)</a>.

                                <strong>Canti di Montagna (1998).</strong> This is the specific edition I have in my library, songs are
                                written in Italian, Venetian and Friulan dialects.

                        Middle school went by quickly, and my musical interest shifted towards the pop/dance wave of the early 2010s.
                        I have to admit that the social pressure to fit in with friends and classmates largely drove my music choices
                        during that period, but I can’t deny that there were some memorable tracks I still enjoy today, such as
                        <a href="https://genius.com/Katy-perry-california-gurls-lyrics"><i>California Gurls</i></a>,
                        <a href="https://genius.com/David-guetta-memories-lyrics"><i>Memories</i></a>, and
                        <a href="https://genius.com/Pitbull-and-ne-yo-time-of-our-lives-lyrics"><i>Time of Our Lives</i></a>... but let's
                        not kid ourselves, here is the elephant in the room:

                        In high school, I gradually started regaining some independence in my music tastes. In total antithesis to the
                        music I listened to in previous years, I started alternating between <a href="https://genius.com/albums/The-beatles/Sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band">
                        <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i></a> and <a href="https://genius.com/albums/The-beatles/Abbey-road">
                        <i>Abbey Road</i></a>. I also dabbled in psychedelic rock with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Jefferson-airplane">
                        <i>Jefferson Airplane</i></a> and the hard rock of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ac-dc"><i>AC/DC</i></a>.
                        During this time, I rediscovered the one band that is probably my favorite right now: the <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Dire-straits">
                        <i>Dire Straits</i></a>. I’m in love with <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dire-straits/Making-movies"><i>Making Movies</i></a>
                        and <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dire-straits/Love-over-gold"><i>Love Over Gold</i></a>, but I could listen
                        to <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dire-straits/Brothers-in-arms"><i>Brothers in Arms</i></a> forever.

                                Frontman, guitaist, song-writer of the Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler is considered by many one of the greates

                        In the last year of high school, I made peace with myself and realized it’s okay to be influenced by global trends.
                        I started to give more space and time to indie and rap—two genres that, in Italy, were still underground at the time.
                        I first got into these genres with two specific albums: <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Calcutta/Mainstream">
                        <i>Mainstream</i></a> and <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Salmo/Hellvisback"><i>Hellvisback</i></a>. I then delved
                        deeper into the Italian scene, discovering and falling in love with many other artists like
                        <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Frah-quintale"><i>Frah Quintale</i></a>, the members of the
                        <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Lovegang126"><i>Lovegang126</i></a> clique, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Marracash">
                        <i>Marracash</i></a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Gue"><i>Gué Pequeno</i></a>.

                                From 2018 I started going to a lot of concerts, which is by far the best way to enjoy music.

                        During my university years, I realized that there isn’t really a genre of music I dislike; rather, there are artists
                        I enjoy and others that bore me. I began to explore pretty much every angle and shade of music—from jazz
                        (<a href="https://genius.com/albums/Duke-ellington-and-john-coltrane/Duke-ellington-john-coltrane"><i>Duke Ellington & John Coltrane</i></a>,
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBC5F3yWcYVo4knj2ZPV6U_4aW06_UufO"><i>The Cuban Tapes</i></a>)
                        to electronic (<a href="https://genius.com/albums/Fatboy-slim/You-ve-come-a-long-way-baby"><i>You’ve Come a Long Way, Baby</i></a>,
                        <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Paul-kalkbrenner/Berlin-calling"><i>Berlin Calling</i></a>), and even reggaeton (<a href="https://genius.com/albums/Bad-bunny/Yhlqmdlg"><i>YHLQMDLG</i></a>).
                        Nevertheless, I found that hip-hop and rock ’n’ roll were the worlds I most enjoyed exploring. I dedicated a lot of
                        time to understanding their roots and where they intersect. When I consciously heard
                        <a href="https://genius.com/Rage-against-the-machine-killing-in-the-name-lyrics"><i>Killing in the Name</i></a> for
                        the first time, it felt like an epiphany. Funnily enough, it happened while I was on vacation with my sisters in Lisbon,
                        where we stumbled upon a Neuroethology conference and a cover band was performing it on ukuleles. From there, I dove into
                        the entire discography of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Rage-against-the-machine"><i>Rage Against the Machine</i></a>
                        and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Beastie-boys"><i>Beastie Boys</i></a>. Not far from this wave is a playlist I’ve
                        curated according to my taste, also influenced by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747"><i>Breaking Bad</i></a>,
                        as you can probably tell.
