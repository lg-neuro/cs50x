                        Sports have always played a huge role in my life. If you asked me what would be the one topic I would never get bored
                        talking about, it would be without any doubt sports. I believe that this huge passion was gently imposed by my father
                        who is an avid fan like mine: he follows just about everything—soccer, basketball, baseball, American football, hockey,
                        tennis, and Formula 1. He even took part as author in a book narrating American sport stories.

                        One of my earliest memories is playing baseball with my father in my backyard, which was – and would still be – pretty
                        unusual for an Italian kid. In fact, I think I was the only one in my town who even owned a baseball bat. Although I really
                        enjoyed baseball, I started playing basketball when I was six years old, and I have been on the court ever since, moving
                        through different local and school teams as I grew up.

                        When it comes to American sports, I have followed in my dad’s footsteps and cheer for all the Boston teams—the Red Sox,
                        Celtics, Patriots, and Bruins. One of my best experiences was in 2019 when my family and I traveled to the U.S. and caught
                        two Red Sox games at Fenway Park: the atmosphere was awsome. We also visited the TD Garden and made a stop in Foxboro to
                        see the Patriots’ stadium. One day, I will definitely go back to catch a live football or basketball game. In the meantime,
                        I had the pleasure to see Wembanyama, raising star of the NBA, play with Metropolitans 92, his former french team, in Paris.

                                amazing tickets, just behind the plate; at the end of the game we managed to reach the first row as people were leaving.
                                That night Mookie Betts was terrific, he went 4 on 5 at bat, with 2 home runs and 5 RBIs.

                        As for soccer, like many in my family, I support Udinese and Inter Milan in Serie A. I have special memories of watching
                        Udinese at the stadium during middle school. One incredible season was the 2011/12 in which they finished third in Serie A,
                        allowing them to play in the UEFA Europa League against Liverpool, my favorite Premier League team: my heart was split in two
                        and in the end Udinese lost but I will never forget those emotions. I would love to make it to Anfield one day to see Liverpool
                        play live.

                                the opportunity to see Messi and Mbappe play when they were still together at Paris Saint-Germain. Ironically, they lost
                                that game 1-3 against Lens, but almost everytime Messi touched the ball the whole stadium was screaming from the exitement.

                        Like every Italian, I am a big Ferrari fan. I have been to Imola twice, in 2022 and 2024, although I am starting to think I am
                        not a lucky charm since Ferrari didn’t have much success either time. I would highly recommend anyone to go at least once to see
                        F1 live, even if you are not a fan you will be impressed how crazy fast they enter the corners.

                                Imola to attend the F1 Grand Prix. As the last time, it was an amazing experience and Leclerc was also on the podium this time.

                        I also follow tennis pretty closely. Living in Paris for the last year, I have had the chance to attend the Roland Garros tournament,
                        and thanks to a special all-around ticket, I saw Fritz play Ruud on the Philippe Chatrier Court. I also attended the Paris Masters 1000
                        at the Accor Arena, where I attended a Djokovic game, it was a dream. Naturally, I cheer for Jannik Sinner, but there is an exciting
                        wave of young Italian players coming up, and I’m looking forward to seeing what they will achieve.

                                against Rune, which we saw winning against Altmaier 6-3 6-3 in the game right after.
