I started looking into Bootstrap for a clean navbar design (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/navbar/)
and I chose it since it seemed cool and clear. From Bootstrap, then, I also chose the footer design I liked the most.

Concerning JavaScript, I wanted the user to be able to click on one of those buttons that allows them to directly
open an email destined to me and I looked how to build one on Google using JavaScript.
