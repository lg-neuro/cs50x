I would calculate the average energy, valence, and danceability, of the top 100 listened to songs (as written in the text) and
set three a priori tables containing adjectives for each combination of two of the three values. Of course, since a table containing
100 x 100 adjectives (considering to approximate the averages to two decimals) would be unnecessarily too specific, I would set
some boundaries, maybe in the order of .2 (therefore five values for each average), and propose three 5 x 5 tables with 75 adjectives
representative of "moods": I would treat these three tables as a graph (e.g., on x energy and y valence) and select the mood at
the intersection of the two values. Then, out of the three outputs, I would consider the proximity to the boundaries of their
"mood" value to choose the most representative ones (the closer to the boundaries is discarded).

To start, I want to say that it is almost impossible to calculate an absolute audio aura for the majority of people since their
mood (and consequently what they listen to) largely depends on very variable things like the hour of the day, the part of the year,
and, most importantly, what is going on in their life. That said, sticking with the algorithm on the first answer, I think a more
accurate way to calculate a person's audio aura would be to, first, give all the three calculated mood adjectives, second, consider
dividing what's listened in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening, providing three "sub-audio auras" and only if some
pattern is found to give a general one, third, take into account more songs, e.g., the top 500 listened to songs, and, fourth,
compute a weighted average to provide more importance to the values of the most listened-to songs.
