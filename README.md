# My CS50x repositoty

In this repository you will find all the resolved problems sets, together with my final project, a Swift-based app for iOS called Counter.

For some projects, due to memory constrains, you will not find all the necessary files to successfully run programs (e.g., datasets, images, videos).

All source code is available through the official [CS50x website](https://www.example.com).
